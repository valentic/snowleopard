#   Check the modem lockfile to see if a dialin shell process has
#   been around "too long" - indicating that the connection was
#   dropped while somebody had been logged in. Sometimes the shell
#   doesn't logout and busybox sh doesn't have a timeout parameter
#   that would automatically logout the shell.
#
#   To work around that, we check the date of the lockfile and
#   kill the owner process if the file is older than 4-hours
#   (an unlikely duration for an Iridium dialup). The process
#   is only killed if the lock indicates it is /bin/sh
#

#               Initial implementation.

#               Reduce timeout to be 60 minutes since this usually
#                   happens when we are interactively working on
#                   the system. A shorter timeout means I can get
#                   back on sooner.
#

#               Reduce to 10 minutes.
